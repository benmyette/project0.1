Free Cloud Platform to link Many Cloud Storage

As I tried many free cloud explorer like Drive, OneDrove, Dropbox etc. , I noticed.. let's say at least
10 good free cloud storage provider for Android on the Play store.

I would like to create my own cloud storage interface that link them all.
Take note that I don't need it personaly since I've learned to create my own ''web access offline server''.
But after quite a long search, seems like I couldn't find a really good interface with the ability to link them.
I think there's a good market there and a still growing interest.

My plan is to make an interface that shows all updated good clouds and let the user be redirect to them.
As the user add a cloud, it should appear in the second swipeable interface to let you manage it.
An interface that act like a file explorer including all cloud folder and the ability to explore them easily.
Options would be: "ADD folders/files to clouds, DELETE files/foldes from clouds, TRANSFER from cloud to cloud,
SHARE a file from cloud to "share it" and the last.. DOWNLOAD from cloud to local.
If possible, I would like to add some ''add an app shortcut" icons on the interface to let the user had his
own shortcuts redirecting him to his local applications.
This option could be usefull to quickly jump over the camera or explore the gallery. 
Or whatever the user want to shortcut.

That's pretty much it.
